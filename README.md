# Bulb-on-off
The Bulb On-Off Project is a web-based interactive experience designed to simulate the control of a light bulb using a virtual switch. This project leverages HTML for structuring the webpage, CSS for styling visual elements, and JavaScript for implementing the dynamic behavior of the switch and bulb.
